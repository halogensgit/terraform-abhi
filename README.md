# Terraform Project README

This Terraform project assumes that your domain or hosted zone is managed by Route 53. Make sure to update the `terraform.tfvars` file in both `main` and `s3-dynamodb-rb` directories with the necessary changes as required.

## Important Note

This Terraform code does not create PEM keys. Create a PEM key manually via the AWS console and add the name of the PEM key in the `terraform.tfvars` file in the `main` directory.

## Directory Structure

- **s3-dynamodb-rb**: Contains Terraform code for setting up an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for remote backend.
- **main**: Contains the main Terraform configuration for your project.

## Configuration Instructions

### General Instructions

1. **Update Placeholder Values**:

   - Replace all placeholder values with your actual data.

2. **Review Configurations**:
   - Check all configurations for any other placeholders or necessary adjustments denoted by comments.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage AWS resources.
- Double-check all configurations before deploying to avoid any issues.
